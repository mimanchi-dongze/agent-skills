# Skill: Agent Creator

Automate the setup of AI-native projects by generating high-density `AGENTS.md` context and managing skills across multiple AI platforms (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf).

## Commands

### `agent-creator init`
Initialize a new project with natural language goals, automated skill discovery, and passive context generation.

## Usage
Add this skill to your environment to streamline agent setup:
1. Run `npx skills add @codemi/agent-creator` (once registered) or use locally.
2. Type `/agent-creator` in your AI coding tool to start the setup flow.

## Description
This skill turns any project into an AI-ready environment. It scans your repository to create a persistent context that helps AI agents understand your architecture, commands, and conventions without wasting tokens on repetitive explanations.
